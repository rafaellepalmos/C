###[McDonald's Project](/BG1220_McD/)

######Introduction
I have written a program that will calculate a typical McDonald’s branch its sales and daily profit.  I take the position of the cashier and collect orders from the customer.  My program is supposed to calculate the amount due and the change.  In addition to this, I store how many customers made their orders and how much profit per day.  All these are also made available in text files: Receipt.txt and Data.txt.

######Project Description
Here I have made a program that asks the user about the type of order the customer would want (i.e. delivery or dine-in).  The user here is the cashier.  Based on the type of order, the user, which in this case is the cashier, inputs the data into the program.  The program then asks the kind of order the customer would like to make.  The order may be a set or a single meal.  The program then asks whether the customer would like to upgrade his/her meal.  And if yes, then it demands for the size of upgrade the customer would like to have.  If an invalid code is entered this program does not respond to it and constantly asks the user/cashier to input the correct data.  After the order is made, the program sums up the total amount of the cost of the order.  Then, it asks the user for the payment.  If the user inputs a wrong amount, such as an amount less than the total amount, it shows an error.  It then asks the user to enter the correct amount. After this the program calculates the change, if there is any and displays it on the screen. The program will prompt the user whether to make a new set of orders or to exit the program.  If yes, then it again asks for the type of delivery followed by the order and the cycle repeats.  But if there are no more orders to be made for the rest of the day, the program counts the total number of customers for the day they had, and then it calculates the total profit they made for the whole day.  In this program, we have used different kinds of loops. This includes the switch statement, do-while statement, differential equations, the for-statement, the if-else statement.

Here, we prompt the user to make a new order or to exit the program

Then, we ask if the customer would like a delivery order or not

Here, we prompt the user to take the order or end the order

We then gather the order of the customer

When done, we calculate for the total amount to be paid, the amount paid and the change due

By the end of the day, the number of customers are counted and the overall profit is displayed
